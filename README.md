Milestone 2:

GUI-based version (now you’re adding the View and the Controller!) of the
bare-bones version of the game + Unit tests for the Model. The code is allowed to
“smell” at this point.

• Deliverables: readme file + design + corresponding tests + code + documentation,
all in one zip file. In particular, document the changes you made to your UML and
data structures from Milestone 1 and explain why. Proper division of the project
into several packages at this point is recommended.

• Deadline: Monday November 16th. Weight: 20% of the overall project grade. 

Group 6:

Amandeep Singh: Coding for Model,Controller readme file and class diagrams

Zoha Mehdi: Coding for View, Controller and writing the JUnit tests.

Toluwalope Ajisola: Commenting, indentatation and refactoring issues of the code.

James Desorsiers: Sequence Diagrams.

The ZIP file contains the contains the a jar file that contains the code which is further on divided into different packages of 
classes acting as VIEW, classes acting as MODEL, the contoller package consists of the controller class, tests for testing the sunflower
class, peashooter class, level class, Explosive Zombie class. The ZIP file also contains the class diagram and the sequence diagrams under the 
diagrams folder.

Different kinds of datastructures have been used for the Milestone.Includes Arraylist that contains the Zombies,the characters and many more.
We have also used the cloneable and serialization interfaces becauseWhen you use some marker interface(no method implementation ) you want to tell jvm or compiler for adding or checking something during runtime or compile time.

The Previous design for the console game of the version was was using the classes like commandwords ans were missing classes like peashooter, sunflowers.
So, comparing it from the previous version of the game we have added the new helper classes for the model like plant, peashooter, zombie , sunflower ,level classes that we missing in the milestone 1.
The View, Controller have been added, as well as the we have restructured and redesigned the Model classes as directed by the marking TA for milestone 2.


We are still working on the implementation to put in the button to skip a turn, but for this milestone we have not achieved that yet. THe new LEVEL in the menubar
